description: Learn about using organization slugs in URLs to manage the active Clerk organization.
---

With Clerk Organizations, users can create entities that represent their companies within your
application. Users can be members of multiple organizations, but can only have one "active" at
any given time. Clerk automatically sets organizations as active when a user picks an organization
with a pre-built component (e.g. the Organization Switcher), and clerk provides APIs (like
auth() and useAuth()), that let you determine the active organization and render the appropriate
content.

Historically, many applications have also chosen to represent organization scoped spaces within
their app by prefixing their URLs with an organization slug. For example, imagine a b2b application
named "Petstore" that has two customers, "Acmecorp" and "Widgetco". The application may choose to
have urls like:

`https://petstore.example.com/orgs/acmecorp/dashboard` <- indicates Acmecorp's dashboard
`https://petstore.example.com/orgs/widgetco/dashboard` <- indicates Widgetco's dashboard

Caution: Think carefully about whether you need to include organization slugs in URLs! Consider:

- Will organization-specific links be more useful for your application than
organization-agnostic links? If most users will only ever be in one organization (that represents
their company), they won't need the organization slug to disambiguate the org when sharing
links with their coworkers. Public documentation, marketing, and third-party blogs are also
made easier if links aren't tied to any specific organization.
- Adding an additional piece of state that indicates the organization will require additional
complexity in your application, as opposed to managing it soley and transparently in the clerk
session.

If your application does need to manage the active organization via the URl though, this guide
will cover the best practices for doing so, specifically for nextjs applications that use
server components.

## Setting and Customizing the Organization Slug

When your users create organizations, a `slug` is automatically created based on
the organization name. You can also allow your users to set or modify the organization
slug via our components.

## Nextjs: Using clerk middleware to set the active organization

Using ClerkMiddleware, it's possible to tell Clerk which URL patterns indicate that a
specific organization or the user's personal account are active. If clerk detects one
of these patterns in nextjs middleware, and it notices that a different organization is
currently active according to the session, it will activate the indicated organization if
possible [1]

## Other applications: Using the setActive


[^1] Implementation Note: If clerk realizes a mismatch, it will attempt to resolve it by
using a handshake, wherein it will redirect the browser back to clerk with a request to
activate the given organization. If it's possible to do so, Clerk will respond with a new
session token with the desired organization as active and redirect back to your application.
