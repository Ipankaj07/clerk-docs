title: Recommended Architecture for Creating Organizations on Users' Behalf
description: Learn how to architectect your application to create organizations on users' behalf without running into rate limits and billing issues.
---

This guide explains how to create organizations on behalf of users for your app. In some use cases, it might be beneficial to create an org for a user automatically during onboarding to ensure all users belong to an org from the start. 

Example use cases:
- You'd like users to be manually onboarded by sales staff and sent an invite to join through an org created for them.
- Your app only functions if users are part of an org, and you want to create the org for them during onboarding.
- You need an "admin account" with access to all orgs in your app, which can be achieved by creating orgs on users' behalf instead of allowing them to create their own.

With the recommended setup, you can avoid unexpected rate limits, billing issues, and poor user experience.

## Recommended Flow

The recommended approach to ensuring that all users are in an organization is to implement an [onboarding flow](/docs/guides/add-onboarding-flow) in which it's required to create an organization before the user is able to access the application. You can use tools like the [`<CreateOrganization>` component](/docs/components/organization/create-organization) to allow the user to create and name their own organization, or you can use Clerk's [Backend API](/docs/reference/backend-api/tag/Organizations#operation/CreateOrganization) or one of our backend SDKs like the [JS Backend SDK](/docs/references/backend/organization/create-organization) to create an organization on the user's behalf and name it as you'd like.

If you'd like to have the your onboarding flow involve the user being invited to join your app via an email, you can use Clerk's [invitation functionality](/docs/users/invitations) to accomplish this. So the overall flow would look as such:

- User receives an invitation to join your application
- Upon clicking the invitation, user registers their account and enters the onboarding flow
- User creates an organization as part of the onboarding flow, and is able to invite colleagues if relevant
- You now have a user that can access your application and is guaranteed to be in an organization

If you'd also like to enable users to join an existing organization that matches their email domain if one exists, as an alternative to creating a new organization, you can use Clerk's [verified domains](/docs/organizations/verified-domains) feature to accomplish this.

## You'd like admin access to all organizations in your app

The easiest way to grant someone on your team admin access to all organizations in your app is to add them as a member to organization on clerk.com. Through Clerk's dashboard, you can see all of the organizations for each of your apps, and take administrative actions, such as adding or removing members, renaming, or deleting an organization.

If for some reason this is not an option, you can use Clerk's [Backend API](/docs/reference/backend-api) or one of our backend SDKs like the [JS Backend SDK](/docs/references/backend/overview), alongside [roles and permissions](/docs/organizations/roles-permissions) to create a custom admin dashboard through which authorized users can can take adminstrative actions for organizations.

## Not recommended: using an admin account to create organizations for users

Although it may seem like a reasonable option, we strongly recommend against using a single admin account to create organizations on the behalf of users. Generally, this is because it can create unexpectedly high costs due to the way that organizations are billed. Let's walk through an example to see why.

Imagine that you have an admin account that is configured to create organizations on a user's behalf during onboarding, then send an invitation to the user to join the organization. When the user accepts the invitation, their organization has an unneccessary extra admin account in it, and additionally at that point, the organization has two monthly active users (MAUs), which make it a active organization. All [Clerk plans](https://clerk.com/pricing) come with 100 active organizations included for free, but over that limit, organizations are billed at $1/month/org. This means that for every user that is created in your app, they have an active organization automatically, because of the fact that the admin account is also in the organization. This tends to result in much higher costs than if users' organizations are created without an admin account included. Additionally, it's generally a nicer user experience for users not to have extra admin accounts in their organizations.

If you have an architecture scenario that isn't covered here or feel that it's critical to create organizations using an admin account, please reach out to us at [support@clerk.com](mailto:support@clerk.com) and we'll be happy to help think through a suitable solution.
