**Maintenance Mode** is a special operational state designed to ensure minimal disruption to signed in users during critical database upgrades or outages.

## Production instances

Mutation methods (`POST`, `PATCH`, `PUT`, `DELETE`) will be rejected with a `503 Service Unavailable` status and an error message informing users that the system is temporarily unavailable. This includes all sign-up and sign-in attempts. Clerk's prebuilt components and the Clerk hosted Account Portal will display errors for these requests.

GET requests, as well as session refresh requests ([`/touch`](/docs/reference/frontend-api/tag/Sessions#operation/touchSession) and [`/tokens`](/docs/reference/frontend-api/tag/Sessions#operation/createSessionToken) endpoints), are not affected. Users who have active sessions (are already signed in) will not be signed out, and will continue to have access to your application, however, any mutations to their user or organization data will return the same `503` error as above.

## Development instances

Development instances will experience full downtime during this period. Users will not be able to sign up or sign in, and already signed in users will be signed out.
