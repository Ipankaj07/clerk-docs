description: Learn how to test the Account Portal flow with Cypress.
---

When testing with Cypress, navigation flows that involve redirects to external URLs can be difficult to test. This guide demonstrates how to use Cypress to test Clerk's Account Portal flow, which involves redirecting to the Account Portal and back to your application.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Check out the [demo repo](https://github.com/clerk/clerk-playwright-nextjs) that demonstrates testing a Clerk-powered application using [Testing Tokens](/docs/testing/overview#testing-tokens). To run the tests, you'll need dev instance Clerk API keys, a test user with username and password, and have username and password authentication enabled in the Clerk Dashboard.

## Get your Account Portal domain

Get your Account Portal domain from the [**Account Portal**](https://dashboard.clerk.com/last-active?path=account-portal) page in the Clerk Dashboard. The format should be: `https://ready-flea-75.accounts.dev`

## The test format

Cypress's `cy.origin()` function lets you visit multiple domains of different origins in the same test. For more information, see the [Cypress documentation](https://docs.cypress.io/api/commands/origin).

By passing your Account Portal domain to `cy.origin()`, your test is able to visit the Account Portal domain and then return to your application.

Structure tests that include Account Portal redirects as follows:

```ts
it('sign in with Account Portal redirects', () => {
  setupClerkTestingToken()

  // Set the origin to the Account Portal domain
  cy.origin('https://ready-flea-75.accounts.dev', () => {
    // Visit a protected page that redirects to the Account Portal when not signed in
    cy.visit('http://localhost:3000/protected')
    // Fill the form to sign in
    // Add any other actions to test
  })

  // The user should be redirected back to the protected page
  cy.url().should('include', '/protected')
})
```

## Example

The following example demonstrates how to create a test that:

- visits a protected page, which redirects to the Account Portal when not signed in.
- fills the form to sign in.
- is redirected back to the protected page.

```ts
import { setupClerkTestingToken } from '@clerk/testing/cypress'

describe('Testing Tokens', () => {
  it('sign in with Account Portal redirects', () => {
    setupClerkTestingToken()

    cy.origin('https://ready-flea-75.accounts.dev', () => {
      cy.visit('http://localhost:3000/protected')
      cy.contains('h1', 'Sign in')
      cy.get('.cl-signIn-root').should('exist')
      cy.get('input[name=identifier]').type(Cypress.env('test_user'))

      cy.get('.cl-formButtonPrimary').contains('button', 'Continue').click()
      cy.get('input[name=password]').type(Cypress.env('test_password'))

      cy.get('.cl-formButtonPrimary').contains('button', 'Continue').click()
    })

    cy.url().should('include', '/protected')
    // Ensure the user has successfully accessed the protected page
    // by checking an element on the page that only the authenticated user can access
    cy.contains('h1', 'This is a PROTECTED page')
  })
})
```
